- [x] Modify velocityX in animateBall() to increase amplitude from *2 to *5 for better spread across slots
- [x] Reduce collision force in checkPinCollisions from 2 to 1 for softer bounces
- [ ] Verify slotIndex calculation covers 0 to 7 adequately
- [ ] Ensure bet multiplication by multiplier is working correctly
- [ ] Test the game by running index.html and dropping balls multiple times to confirm landing on all multipliers
